# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project with PyBer is to analyze the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. This data was taken and sued for a compelling visualizatin for the CEO, using Python and Pandas. We created summary DataFrames based on city type and created a line graph to display the summary. The data shows that different city types differ in data outputs, and thus can be used by PyBer decision makers and stakeholders.

## Results

Data shows rural populations use the rideshare app the least, followed behind suburban communities. Urban cities have the highest use of PyBer. Fare revenue coincides with the city types, as urbans have the highest ratio as well. 

## Summary

In conclusion, ridesharing services vary based on location and city type, based on the number of rides, drivers, and fares. Higher use coincides with urban cities, while rural cities have the least use. Further data and analysis is recommended on the rural cities, to potentially increase driver pools, lowering fare prices. This could increase the use of PyBer in these rural communities.
